Ex.2
A circle.

Ex.3
If the array type was of int.
If the final System.out.println() statement was removed
if algorithm 2 or 3 was used instead

Ex.4
Algorithm 2 makes use of the Arrays.sort() method. 1 comparison
Algorithm 3 keeps track of both the min and max values. n comparisons

Ex.5
3 times per n (3 calls to distance)
So 3n times distance is computed
